# Omit the Docker configuration/specification files from the image build context,
# so we can edit them without invalidating existing image layers.
#
# Note: Although we exclude the `.docker/` directory from the build context, we
#       make an exception for the `wait-for-it.sh` file within it, since we want
#       that specific file to be `COPY`-ed into the `test` container image during
#       that container image's build process (which is defined in `Dockerfile`).
