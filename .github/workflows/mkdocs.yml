      # Build the MkDocs site (but don't deploy it).
      #
      # Note: Until January 17, 2025, we would build and deploy the MkDocs website to GitHub Pages.
      #       As of January 17, 2025, we just _build_ it â€” we don't deploy it.
      #
      #       The reason is that the NMDC has a new, centralized documentation website: https://docs.microbiomedata.org.
      #       That website includes a copy of the Runtime documentation (it's at the path, `/runtime`). Instead of
      #       deploying this redundant copy (being built here) to `https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-runtime`,
      #       we will (via the new `deploy-redirects.yml` workflow) deploy a bunch of HTML files that redirect visitors
      #       from pages on `https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-runtime` to their counterparts on
      #       `https://docs.microbiomedata.org/runtime`.
      #
      #       This redirection is not implemented in the MkDocs site, _itself_, because those MkDocs site source files
      #       are used to build the website hosted at `https://docs.microbiomedata.org/runtime`; and, if a page were
      #       to redirect to itself, the result would be a circular redirect.
      #
      #       The reason we still bother to build the MkDocs site here is so we get an error (a failed GHA workflow run)
      #       when the site is no longer buildable (e.g. due to someone inadvertently introducing an invalid source
      #       file, or due to one of the dependencies becoming unavailable), which can prompt remedial action.
