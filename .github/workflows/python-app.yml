    # Use `mongosh` (available within the `mongo` container) to set up
    # a replicate set of which the MongoDB instance on the `mongo`
    # container is the only member.
    #
    # Note: We do this explicitly here since the "mongo-init" approach
    #       we use on our local computers does not seem to work on GHA.
    #
    # Note: We sleep for a few seconds to give the MongoDB server some
    #       time to boot to the point of being able to process commands.
    #       We run `docker compose ps` to show some information that can
    #       help us debug this step/workflow.
