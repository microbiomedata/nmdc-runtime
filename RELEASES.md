When this file is changed and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub, the deployment on NERSC Spin is
refreshed ([via a GitHub
action](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-to-spin.yml))
to use the latest Docker images (which may be rebuilt [via this GitHub
Action](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-push-docker-images.yml)).

Add a new line to the log below, in reverse chronological order (so the latest release at top), when
you wish to trigger a release. Ensure that the latest Docker images have been built and pushed prior
to triggering a release.
