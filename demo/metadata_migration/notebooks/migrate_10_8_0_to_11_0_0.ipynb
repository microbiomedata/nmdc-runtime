    "This notebook will be used to migrate the database from `nmdc-schema` `v10.8.0` ([released](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/releases/tag/v10.8.0) August 21, 2024) to `v11.0.0` (i.e. the initial version of the so-called \"Berkeley schema\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous migrators, this one does not pick and choose which collections it will dump. There are two reasons for this: (1) migrators no longer have a dedicated `self.agenda` dictionary that indicates all the collections involved in the migration; and (2) this migration is the first one that involves creating, renaming, and dropping any collections; none of which are things that the old `self.agenda`-based system was designed to handle. So, instead of picking and choosing collections, this migrator **dumps them all.**"
