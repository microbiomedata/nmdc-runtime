    Checks whether, if the specified updates were performed on the specified database,
    both of the following things would be true afterward:
    1. (Regarding outgoing references): The updated documents do not contain any
       broken references.
    2. (Regarding incoming references): The documents that originally _referenced_
       any of the updated documents do not contain any broken references.
       This check is necessary because update operations can currently change `id`
       and `type` values, which can affect what can legally reference those documents.

    This function checks those things by performing the updates within a MongoDB
    transaction, leaving the transaction in the _pending_ (i.e. not committed) state,
    and then performing various checks on the database in that _pending_ state.
