    Performs `find`, `aggregate`, `update`, `delete`, and `getMore` commands for users that have adequate permissions.

    For `find` and `aggregate` commands, the requested items will be in `cursor.batch`.
    When the response includes a non-null `cursor.id`, there _may_ be more items available.
    To retrieve the next batch of items, submit a request with `getMore` set to that non-null `cursor.id`.
    When the response includes a null `cursor.id`, there are no more items available.

    **Example request bodies:**

    Get all\* biosamples.
    ```
    {
      "find": "biosample_set",
      "filter": {}
    }
    ```

    Get all\* biosamples associated with a given study.
    ```
    {
      "find": "biosample_set",
      "filter": {"associated_studies": "nmdc:sty-11-34xj1150"}
    }
    ```

    \*<small>Up to 101, which is the default "batchSize" for the "find" command.</small>

    Get the first 200 biosamples associated with a given study.
    ```
    {
      "find": "biosample_set",
      "filter": {"associated_studies": "nmdc:sty-11-34xj1150"},
      "batchSize": 200
    }
    ```

    Delete the first biosample having a given `id`.
    ```
    {
      "delete": "biosample_set",
      "deletes": [{"q": {"id": "A_BIOSAMPLE_ID"}, "limit": 1}]
    }
    ```

    Rename the first\* embargoed biosample.
    ```
    {
      "update": "biosample_set",
      "updates": [{"q": {"embargoed": true}, "u": {"$set": {"name": "A_NEW_NAME"}}}]
    }
    ```

    \*<small>Updates at most 1 matching document, since `"multi": true` is not present.</small>

    Rename all\* embargoed biosamples.
    ```
    {
      "update": "biosample_set",
      "updates": [{"q": {"embargoed": true}, "u": {"$set": {"name": "A_NEW_NAME"}}, "multi": true}]
    }
    ```

    \*<small>Updates all matching documents, since `"multi": true` is present.</small>

    Get all\* biosamples, sorted by the number of studies associated with them (greatest to least).
    ```
    {
      "aggregate": "biosample_set",
      "pipeline": [{"$sortByCount": "$associated_studies"}]
    }
    ```

    \*<small>Up to 25, which is the default "batchSize" for the "aggregate" command.</small>

    Get the first 10 biosamples having the largest numbers of studies associated with them,
    sorted by that number of studies (greatest to least).
    ```
    {
      "aggregate": "biosample_set",
      "pipeline": [{"$sortByCount": "$associated_studies"}],
      "cursor": {"batchSize": 10}
    }
    ```

    Use the `cursor.id` from a previous response to get the next batch of results,
    whether that batch is empty or non-empty.
    ```
    {
      "getMore": "somecursorid"
    }
    ```

    **Limitations:**

    1. The maximum size of the response payload is 16 MB. You can use the "batchSize" property
       (for "find" commands) or the "cursor.batchSize" property (for "aggregate" commands)—along
       with some trial and error—to ensure the response payload size remains under that limit.
    2. When using an "aggregate" command, if any of the objects output by the pipeline lacks an
       "_id" field, the endpoint will return only the first batch of objects and will not offer
       pagination (i.e. "cursor.id" will be null).
    3. Manipulating the values of "_id" fields within an aggregation pipeline (e.g. via "$set")
       can result in pagination not working. If this impacts your use case, please contact us.

    Additional notes for developers:*
    --------------------------------
    * Note: Because this section isn't in the main docstring,
            it isn't visible on Swagger UI.

    1. The sorting part of the pagination algorithm is based upon the assumption
       that the `_id` values of the documents are "deterministically sortable."
       However, an aggregation pipeline can be used to populate the `_id` field
       with values that are _not_ "deterministically sortable." For example,
       the final stage of the pipeline could be: `{ "$set": { "_id": "potato" } }`
