# This file contains a list of the direct (as opposed to transitive) production dependencies of
# the `nmdc_runtime` package. We use `pip-compile` (typically via `$ make update-deps`) to derive
# the "requirements.txt" file from this file.
#
# Reference: https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements-from-requirementsin
#
# Note: To specify that a Python package be built from the contents of a GitHub repository (which can
#       be useful for integration testing before that Python package gets published to PyPI), you can
#       use the following syntax in this file:
#       ```
#       {package_name} @ git+https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}.git@{commit}
#       ```
#       For example:
#       ```
#       refscan @ git+https://github.com/microbiomedata/refscan.git@b4f6bab138d2158ece7ea2423a27d8b8493d02f5
#       ```
#
# TODO: Consider moving our "first-party" dependencies (e.g. `nmdc-schema`, `ontology-loader`, `refscan`)
#       to a group at the top of the file or a separate requirements file.
