This directory contains file related to testing code written in the `nmdc_runtime/util.py` file.

I named the directory "`test_util`" in an attempt to follow the naming convention of the other test directories.
In its name, "`test`" is a verb and "`util`" is a noun (i.e. "to test the utility"). This is in contrast to the file 
`../test_util.py`, in whose name "`test`" is an adjective and "`util`" is a noun (i.e. "a test-related utility").
